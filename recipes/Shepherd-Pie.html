    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Add potatoes, and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain, 
            and return to pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            While potatoes are boiling, heat oil in a large skillet. 
            Cook ground beef with onion, red pepper, and garlic until beef is evenly brown. 
            Stir in beef broth, ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and curry powder. 
            Bring to a boil, and simmer 3 to 4 minutes. Mix cornstarch with a little water to form a paste, 
            then stir into skillet with tomatoes, peas and carrots. 
            Cook until thickened; season with salt and pepper. Spoon into a casserole dish.

            Preheat oven on broiler setting. Add milk and butter to cooked potatoes, 
            and whip until smooth and creamy. Spoon over meat mixture. 
            Sprinkle top with shredded cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place under broiler for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted and speckled with brown.
